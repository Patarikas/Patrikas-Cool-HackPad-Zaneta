# Patrikas's-Cool-HackPad-Žaneta
My HackPad is called Žaneta. It has 6 keys, a rotary encoder and an OLED display.

## What does it do
The keys are for shortcuts in edditing softwares and 3D modeling softwares also they will be used as switches for lights, turn signals and other car features in games like BeamNG Drive and RFactor.

The Rotary encoder will be used for adjusting the volume

And the Display will show the volume. I plan on adding more features to the display but this is all for now.

## The Case
The case has 3 pieces: the main body, the top cover and the bottom piece whitch seeds the XIAO and inclines the whole HackPad for better use.

It fits together using 7 M3 bolts and 7 heatset inserts, 1 for the PCB, 2 for attaching the bottom piece and 4 for the top cover.

(The case is just from the default material and the keycaps are not plain because in the 3D models I downloaded weren't any plain ones, and even creating this case took me too much time and energy, so I just left it how it is.)

## The PCB and the Schematics
I made it all in KiCad and the PCB has a silk screen with the name of the HackPad.

## The Firmware
So I made my firmware using VSC and it's chat function, because I just can't wrap  my head around code in general, and even creating the PCB and using Fusion for the first time was a little too much for me. But I plan on learning basic coding in the near future.

## BOM
- 6x MX Switches
- 6x Keycaps
- 7x M3x5x4 Heatset inserts
- 7x M3x6 Bolts
- 3D printed Case parts

## Some Extra Words 
This project was realy fun but really hard and frustrating at the same time. The reason for that is that working in new to me programs and learning how to do stuff in them was really time consuming, preticulary Fusion because previously I've worked in other 3D modeling softwares and Fusion is really different from all of them.
The last thing that I want to say is thanks to all of the people that took part in this, because I wanted to learn how to make something like this for a long time, but I didn't know where to begin.
(Also I am sorry for any miss spelled or badly used words, because English is not my first language)
